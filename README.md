# zebrafish_VMR_analysis
Welcome to the online repository of my scripts for analyzing Visual Motor Response (VMR) data collected from zebrafish larvae. During development of our analytical pipeline, we took reference to the work of research groups who pioneered the VMR assay. Please refer to the reference section of the readme file. As building VMR analytical pipeline is an evolving effort, all the codes in the GitHub repository are subject to changes for different research projects/publications.
