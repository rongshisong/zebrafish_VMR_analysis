# zebrafish_VMR_analysis
Welcome to the online repository of zebrafish Visual Motor Response (VMR) analytical tool for recoding and analyzing VMR data collected from zebrafish larvae using ZebraLab by ViewPoint. As building VMR analytical pipeline is an evolving effort, all the codes in this repository are subject to changes for different research projects and publications. During the development of the analytical pipeline, we took reference to the work of researchers who pioneered the VMR assay. Please refer to the reference section at the end of the readme file.

# List of publicaitons using this pipeline:
